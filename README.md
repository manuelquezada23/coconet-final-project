# Coconet

## Executive Summary

The life science industry is extremely important to Puerto Rico’s economy, making up around 30% of their GDP each year. With the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the USA is heavily reliant on foreign medical manufacturing, presenting a unique opportunity for Puerto Rico to become the manufacturing hub it once was.

However, companies that want to relocate to Puerto Rico and even the ones that already operate there, need engineering firms or service providers that are qualified to work on their projects. Project managers can take over two months to find a qualified service provider. 

Coconet is a web platform where project managers can browse, find, and work with qualified service providers for their projects. Our client believes that with such platform, medical manufacturers will be able to cut down the qualification process from 2 months to perhaps 1 or 2 weeks and potentially cut costs by upwards of 25%. This would add tremendous value to the medical manufacturing industry and help rebuild Puerto Rico’s economy.

There are two user bases in this web application: users and service providers. Users can sign up, create a profile, and then browse qualified service providers to work with. Service providers can sign up, create a profile, and get qualified to use Coconet. They can display their information, past projects, qualifications, among other information that will help users understand what they're about.
